# XarDos

XarDos is a simple software designed for the Arduino Development Platform (aka small, a bit low-level microcontroller).
It allows you tu run various tasks and programs on your Arduino board, kinda like a small computer.
If you're planning to install XarDos, please use an Arduino Mega 2560, rather than just a small Uno R3 or Nano.
Model Mega 2560 offers more program storage, SRAM, and EEPROM storage.
